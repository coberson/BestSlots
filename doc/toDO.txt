- make it possible to skip a session (for the time being, takes sessions in order and skips to next session when full); ideas: 1-cheat by constructing new cutWeek vector, removing some sessions 
2-put all sessions together?

- make other tests to see if best slots are found

- remove outputs in bestslots.cpp

- make it possible to show several best slots

- work on view (part for input of participants, part for output (confirmation?))

- work on simplification (remove irrelevant permutations)

- make complexity estimation: nbS! permutations, importance of the number of free slots

- test for efficiency (on the other side, only one run!) 

New way of thinking: begin with students with the less possibilities, attribute session(s)
