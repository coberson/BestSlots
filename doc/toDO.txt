- make other tests to see if best slots are found

- remove outputs in bestslots.cpp

- make it possible to show several best slots

- work on view (part for input of participants, part for output (confirmation?))

- work on simplification (remove irrelevant permutations)

- test for efficiency (on the other side, only one run!)
